- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZoiChi29 (It is just a nickname i invented for someone that is soooo dear to me 💖💖) "you are free to call me whatever you want in this account since it is not a professional one :)"
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber security 🔥, reverse engineering 🔥, and things that require a little bit of thinking. I love to understand them, and create my own version. But TBH... Although this is what i want and try to achieve... It doesnt work as it should be. too much to learn, too many mistakes to be made in order to gain a small expirince about this field x)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Senior Student BS in Computer Science. trying to make mobile applications using flutter. Since i got asked to work on some projects for app dev. In my case, i wont say no to anything. In order to gain experience and understand this huge world step by step.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. If i have a previous experience about it then thats good. if not, i would like to learn more about it, and become handy for others :)
- 📫 How to reach me... well... Dr.trax100@gmail.com (Main email), IIIMohammed.Hussein@gmail.com (Work email), +971 55 6022 988 (Whats)
