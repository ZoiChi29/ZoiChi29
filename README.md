- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZoiChi29 (It is just a nickname i invented for someone who is soooo dear to me 💖💖) "you are free to call me whatever you want in this account since it is not a professional one :)"
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber security 🔥, reverse engineering 🔥, and things that require a little bit of thinking. I love to understand them, and create my own version. But TBH... Although this is what i want and try to achieve... It doesnt work as it should be. too much to learn, too many mistakes to be made in order to gain a small expirince about this field x) (But aint giving up yet x) )
- 🌱 I’m currently a BS Senior Student in Computer Science. Working as an intern student in Manzil Health Care company in the IT department.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. If i have a previous experience about it then thats good. if not, i would like to learn more about it, and become handy for others :)  In order to gain experience and understand this huge world step by step.
- My hobbies are editing videos in my free time. I like editing in general, pretty fun 😁 I also like to develop random things 😃 Games or apps. Used unity before to create some entites and play around with them. And looking forward to try Unreal Engine as well 😃😃
